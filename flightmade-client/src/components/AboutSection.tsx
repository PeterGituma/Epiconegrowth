        How we came to be: Our founder, Peter, a private pilot and aviation enthusiast, 
        saw an opportunity to make private jet travel more accessible to 
        the masses wanting to experience the life of flying private but didn't have the money 
        to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thats where FlightMade comes in.
        Private jets are being fallen all the time all around the world, however there are times when they are
        empty because they are traveling to pick up passengers or returning to base.
        Thats where FlightMade comes in, we connect you during those empty leg flights to experience the life of 
        flying private at a fraction of the cost. The flights were going to be empty anyway, 
        so why not let you enjoy the ride? Thats was the birth of FlightMade.

        <br/> <br/>
        FlightMade is a luxury private jet empty leg marketplace. We aggregate
        live empty flights for people looking to experience the life of flying private, 
        BUT at an affordable price.
        <br/> <br/>
      
        Our platform is designed to make private jet travel accessible and
        affordable for everyone. We believe that luxury air travel should be
        within reach, and we are committed to providing the best options at
        competitive prices.
